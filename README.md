## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this project.

I had a fun time building this project and just getting more familiar with the date object in javascript. I wanted people to know what I can currently do. I have a folder with a bunch of other vanilla javascript files you can look at and see what I've done.
